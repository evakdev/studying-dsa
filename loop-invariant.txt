Loop invariant is something that is True before loop starts,
after each iteration of the loop, and after loop ends. 
It is what we use to prove that the loop is working correctly.


From 'Introduction to Algorithms':
"We use loop invariants to help us understand why an algorithm is correct. We
must show three things about a loop invariant:
Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.
Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the
next iteration.
Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property
that helps show that the algorithm is correct."
